# Energy_consumption_MLModel
This dataset is designed for predicting energy consumption based on various building features and environmental factors. It contains data for multiple building types, square footage, the number of occupants, appliances used, average temperature, and the day of the week. The goal is to build a predictive model to estimate energy consumption using these attributes.

The dataset can be used for training machine learning models such as linear regression to forecast energy needs based on the building's characteristics. This is useful for understanding energy demand patterns and optimizing energy consumption in different building types and environmental conditions.
